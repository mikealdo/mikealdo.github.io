Recently I read good advice by {tk-twitter} about doing {self-retro-blog-post}. After some thinking about the idea I decided to adopt it to my work and personal life. After six weeks of doing it I can share some insights from practical perspective.

== Routine matters
One of the fundamental part of doing self-retros is making notes day by day. So it comes with need to have habit to track stuff at regular time. Because I am adopting self-retro also for personal stuff it was needed to do it twice a day - once before leaving the work and once on the very end of the day. Occasionally I forgot to write down part about personal stuff mainly due to fact that I was enjoying time with my kids, girlfriend and forgot to all the commitments. So I tried to recovery personal part on next morning and it was not so good due to fact that I usually forgot to something during to night.

== Paper wins
Second main experience was that I was started with writing notes to paper notebook and it was quite useful. Instead of need to open PC or notebook/tablet/phone and try to use some application (I am not sure even if I would be able some useful app to find) it was super comfortable to use paper and some color markers. Because it’s giving to you so many variants how the stuff will look it was funny to observe how is my approach changing in time. Once it were text notes, once notes with pictures, smileys and in other time it were illustrations without any text. After all I doubt that some application has such variability. And doing retrospective on that variable designed pages was also quite entertaining.

== Sunday afternoon
I did one retro on Friday afternoon, one on Monday morning and last four on Sunday afternoon. With Friday afternoon I had a problem because it was too long to have opportunity perform some action from list. And it wasn’t taking into account personal part on the weekend. On Monday morning I was not satisfied with not available time something to do with personal items from list. So I believe that if you are doing self-retro also for personal stuff, the time for do it’s Sunday afternoon. If you identify that you miss something personally important you still have some time to do something with it. For work stuff you have another perspective than doing it immediately after work with possible tiredness or frustration. And you are prepared for Monday morning with some list of items so you can start working immediately.

== Retro itself
From agile retrospectives I know that if you are not ending retro with list of things to be done, new approaches to be followed, tickets raised, it’s not useful retrospective. So to have clear list with stuff needs to be done, stuff which has some priority was my first goal. Also I realized that it’s almost necessary to praise myself for such good work on that week to have a feeling that my work/personal balance is acceptable for my living. It’s common that human have ability to forget bad things and doing self-retros helps with seeing things which didn’t work properly and identify stuff for improvement. After rethinking achieved things on that particular week I had sometimes feeling that something important was missing. And realized that I forgot to do something which I had only in my mind for weeks but without placing such activity to any list I always forgot to do it. Nice.

== Third week was most challenging
I don’t know exactly why, but I had problems with my routine on third week. Maybe it was because I was not seeing direct influence to my life, some boring tasks overwhelmed me or I obviously haven’t done anything on some of the day. Or doubts about benefits of doing it. Weird. Fourth week was normal without anomalies and started to be so useful so don’t understand much, maybe you can have some insights how it was possible.

== What will be next?
If I can assess doing self-retro, it’s quite interesting and useful technique if it’s done on regular basis. It particularly helps achieve some work/personal life balance. It successfully beat feeling “I haven’t done anything today”. It helps focusing to important things firstly. So, useful, I recommend it for everyone. As I started with {pomodores} before doing self-retros, it was quite easy to adopt it because I had actual work done on detailed list already. I’ll stick to these to enhancements of my life because it has proven that it works and helps but as always I am open to anything else which can be even more useful. Do you know about something better?
